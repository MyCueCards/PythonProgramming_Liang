Instructions (Page 59, Exercise 2.16):
(Physics: acceleration) Average acceleration is defined as the change of
velocity divided by the time taken to make the change, as shown in the
following formula: a = (v1 − v0) / t Write a program that prompts the user
to enter the starting velocity v0 in meters/second, the ending velocity v1
in meters/second, and the time span t in seconds, and displays the average
acceleration. Here is a sample run:
   Enter v0, v1, and t: 5.5, 50.9, 4.5 [Enter]
   The average acceleration is 10.0889
'''
v0, v1, t = eval(input("Enter v0, v1, and t (seperated by commas): "))
avgAccel = (v1 - v0)/(t)
print("The average acceleration is ", round(avgAccel, 4))
